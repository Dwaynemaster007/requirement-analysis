# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a blueprint for the requirement analysis phase of a booking management system. It contains documentation, diagrams, and key artifacts that define the project's foundation, simulating a real-world software development scenario. The goal is to translate project needs into structured, clear, and actionable requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the needs and constraints for a software system. It involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, analyzing them for clarity and consistency, and creating a detailed specification. This phase is a critical part of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it ensures that all parties involved have a shared understanding of what the final product should do.

The importance of this step cannot be overstated. A thorough requirement analysis helps to:

* **Prevent project failure:** By identifying potential issues early, it reduces the risk of building the wrong product.
* **Reduce costs:** Changes made late in the development cycle are significantly more expensive to implement.
* **Improve communication:** It creates a common language for developers, designers, and stakeholders, minimizing misunderstandings.
* **Provide a foundation for testing:** Clear requirements form the basis for creating test cases and validating the final product.
